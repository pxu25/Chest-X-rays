3 CHECK HOMEBREW
brew doctor

bens-mbp:~ ben$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
4 UPDATE HOMEBREW
brew update

bens-mbp:~ ben$ brew update
Already up-to-date.
5 VERIFY MARIADB VERSION IN HOMEBREW REPO
brew info mariadb

Bens-MacBook-Pro:~ ben$ brew info mariadb
mariadb: stable 10.1.16 (bottled), devel 10.2.1
Drop-in replacement for MySQL
https://mariadb.org/
Conflicts with: mariadb-connector-c, mysql, mysql-cluster, mysql-connector-c, mytop, percona-server
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mariadb.rb
==> Dependencies
Build: cmake ✘
Required: openssl ✘
==> Options

A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mariadb now and restart at login:
  brew services start mariadb
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mysql.server start
6 INSTALL MARIADB
brew install mariadb

==> Caveats
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

'/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
'/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h Bens-MacBook-Pro.local password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
'/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb or the
MySQL manual for more instructions.

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16' ; /usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='/usr/local/var/mysql'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd '/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.1.16/mysql-test' ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems at http://mariadb.org/jira

8 START MARIADB
mysql.server start

Bens-MacBook-Pro:10.1.16 ben$ mysql.server start
Starting MySQL
. SUCCESS!
9 SECURE THE INSTALLATION
mysql_secure_installation

Bens-MacBook-Pro:10.1.16 ben$ mysql_secure_installation

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n]
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]
 ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
